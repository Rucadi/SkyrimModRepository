Permissions and credits

### Author's instructions

\* You may upload unmodified copies of the latest version of the patch to any website of your choosing so long as the documentation is retained as-is. All credits must be properly maintained, and you are responsible for making sure the updates are taken care of on the site it's uploaded to.  
\* Porting this mod for use on a game other than Skyrim Special Edition is strictly prohibited. Examples of "other games" include (but are not limited to) Skyrim VR, Skyrim Legendary Edition, etc.  
\* Porting this mod to a platform where modding is not officially supported or legally allowed is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, Nintendo Switch, PS4, or other consoles.  
\* Translation of the unofficial patches into other languages is permitted so long as the English documentation is also included and all credits are properly maintained and all provisions of previous terms are adhered to.  
\* Assets such as mesh files (.nif), textures, scripts, audio files, and other things found in the BSA may be freely used as the basis for your own work in order to help prevent fixes from being lost due to work starting from broken vanilla assets instead.  
\* You are permitted to use the unofficial patches as master files in your own work for the purpose of ensuring that fixes are not lost. Please try to be sure any changes to things which have been fixed do not cause further problems as we will not be able to provide support under those conditions.  
\* You may also copy any needed fixes into your own work to use without the USSEP as a master so long as you agree to be responsible for any support issues that arise from doing so and that you will actively keep up with any needed changes in future updates.  
\* Altering fixes is specifically prohibited as this tends to lead to serious problems. If you think you've found an issue with a fix, please report it to us. Do not simply upload something that amounts to "this is the right way to do it" because more often than not, this turns out to be false and people mistakenly believe we are at fault when we are not aware of what's been done.  
\* The Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch may not be included in any "mod packs" under any circumstances.

NOT SUPPORTED ON OLDER VERSIONS!!!

  
A comprehensive bugfixing mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition. The goal of the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (aka USSEP) is to eventually fix every bug with Skyrim Special Edition not officially resolved by the developers to the limits of the Creation Kit and community-developed tools, in one easy-to-install package.  
     
   Features:  
   - Hundreds of gameplay, quest, NPC, object, item, text and placement bugs fixed.  
   - Created by the authors of the Unofficial Oblivion Patch series.  
   - No unsafe changes (such as deletions of stock objects).  
   - Designed to be compatible with as many other mods as possible.  
     
   For more information (ie the recent changelog, mods that USSEP replaces) see [USSEP's threads on the AFK Mods forum here](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/forum/351-unofficial-skyrim-special-edition-patches/).

DO NOT extract the contents of the BSA file into your Data folder as loose files, or let your mod manager perform an equivalent function on the contents of the file. Doing so will cause things to load in the wrong order and break the game. Skyrim is intended to load a BSA alongside it's ESM/ESP file. Circumventing this causes issues which I will not provide support for. If you insist on going against this advice, you will receive no support for the problems you generate as a result of this.  
  
**Installation Requirements**  
  
Skyrim Special Edition 1.6.323 or greater.  
  
After installing the mods, the following general load order needs to be followed:  
  
Skyrim.esm  
Update.esm  
Dawnguard.esm  
Hearthfires.esm  
Dragonborn.esm  
\[any Creation Club master-flagged ESLs you may have\]  
Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp  
\[The rest of your mods\]  
  
For getting load order set with other mods loaded, please use [LOOT](https://loot.github.io/). It will provide you a solid starting point for everything that you can then tweak as needed.  
  
**Errors During NMM Installation**  
  
If you get the following error:  
  
BOSS\_API\_ERROR\_INVALID\_ARGS: Master files must load before other plugins. The mod was not installed.  
  
You need to perform the following steps:  
  
\- Uninstall and delete all the Unofficial patches in NMM.  
\- Exit NMM.  
\- Launch NMM again.  
\- Download and install all of the updated Unofficial Patches.  
\- Run LOOT to sort your load order.  
  
**Cannot Absorb Dragon Souls**  
  
Make sure your load order is right!  
  
Skyrim.esm  
Update.esm  
Dawnguard.esm  
Hearthfires.esm  
Dragonborn.esm  
USSEP  
\[The rest of your mods\]  
  
Use LOOT - you'll enjoy life more.  
  
Loose Scripts in DataScripts  
  
Check for: dragonactorscript.pex and/or mqkilldragonscript.pex. Remove them if present. They are from dragon mods that came as loose files.  
  
DSAMG - Dragon Soul Absorb More Glorious, and Diversified Dragons are known to cause this. Those mods need to be updated with a Dragonborn patch that incorporates the fixes from USLEEP.  
  
Others may be a factor as well.  
  
Note too that the offending mod may have the script packaged inside a BSA. That will need to be handled by that mod's author.

This mod is not made, guaranteed, or supported by Microsoft, Zenimax, Bethesda Game Studios, or any of their affiliates.
